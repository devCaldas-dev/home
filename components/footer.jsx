                  This website began as a clone of Takuya Matsuyama&apos;s
                  portfolio — a decision I made consciously and with purpose.

                  Back then, I was just beginning to learn HTML, CSS, and
                  JavaScript. I was eager to create something real and visible.
                  Cloning was not about copying — it was my first hands-on
                  project, my lab, my training ground.

                <Text>
                  Since then, I&apos;ve expanded and transformed the site to
                  reflect my own voice, projects, and identity as a developer.
                  From mastering Git and GitHub to learning Next.js, Chakra UI,
                  React, and web components — this website has been my best
                  teacher.
                </Text>
                <Text>
                  I proudly keep the acknowledgment to Matsuyama in the footer,
                  and I will continue to evolve this platform while staying true
                  to my origin.
                </Text>
                <Text>
                  Thanks to this project, I stepped into the world of web
                  development — and I&apos;ve never looked back.
